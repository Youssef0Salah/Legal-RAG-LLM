            "*   **Regulation of Economic Transactions:** Roman law, or at least parts of it, was seen as better suited to regulate complex economic transactions than customary rules.\n",
            "*   **Influence on Modern Law:** Roman law continues to influence legal systems today, even where codes are based on national languages. Knowledge of Roman law remains essential.\n",
